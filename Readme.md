This is a proof of concept CLI tool to convert Heroicons Svg in Vue components
I developed it to help with the development of a library at work (and mostly for fun) so it has a lot of opinions about what Vue components it will generate (mixins, TS, compostion API etc...)

## Usage

Clone this repository
Install dependencies with `yarn`
Download all of heroicons icons and unzip the "optimized" ones in this projects `src` folder.
Run `yarn dev`
Find your Vue components in `src/output`
Copy them in your project or whatever
